# Notes for Developers

Admin: updating mkdocs documentation

1. update the docs and commit your changes
2. `mkdocs build` to update the docs
    * note: if you don't already have mkdocs, install with:
    `conda install -c conda-forge mkdocs`
3. if you haven't already, install ghp-import:
    ```
    conda install -c conda-forge ghp-import
    ```
4. use ghp-import to push the updated to docs to the  gh-pages branch

Some useful conda, snakemake, workflow hints:

# optional: to make conda installs simpler, set up conda configuration
    conda config --set always_yes yes --set changeps1 no
    conda config --add channels conda-forge
    conda config --add channels defaults
    conda config --add channels bioconda

# If you need to modify a conda package:

 you'll need to work with a local install of that package. 
 Here's how to use conda to install the dependenciesfrom the conda recipe.
 see also https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs.html#building-and-installing

 install conda-build  

    ```
    conda install conda-build
    ```

 clone the repo of interest and cd into it  
     
     ```
     git clone dammit-repo
     cd dammit-repo
     ```

 There should be a folder called recipe. 
 Use conda-build to build it.  
    
    ``` 
    conda build recipe
    ```

 Install the local code  
    
    ```
    conda install dammit --use-local
    # or, you can use pip:
    # pip install -e . â€”no-deps
    ```
