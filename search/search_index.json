You'll need to do this anytime you want to run eelpond conda activate eelpond Now you can start running workflows on test data! Default workflow: Eel Pond Protocol for de novo RNAseq analysis \u00b6 The Eel Pond protocol (which inspired the eelpond name) included line-by-line commands that the user could follow along with using a test dataset provided in the instructions. We have re-implemented the protocol here to enable automated de novo transcriptome assembly, annotation, and quick differential expression analysis on a set of short-read Illumina data using a single command. See more about this protocol here . To test the default workflow: ./run_eelpond examples/nema.yaml default This will download and run a small set of Nematostella vectensis test data (from Tulin et al., 2013 ) Running Your Own Data \u00b6 To run your own data, you'll need to create two files: a tsv file containing your sample info a yaml file containing basic configuration info Generate these by following instructions here: Understanding and Configuring Workflows .

It integrates snakemake rules for commonly used tools, and provides several end-to-end protocols for analyzing RNAseq data. Workflows are highly customizable, and all command-line options for each tool are available for modification via the configuration file. Specify Input Data \u00b6 To run any workflow, we need to get reads (and any assemblies already generated) into the right format for eelpond . We can either (1) link the data from another location on your machine, or (2) download the data via http or ftp. This is done through a utility rule called get_data . To specify input data, we generate a my-samples.tsv file, with either file paths or download links If we had our test data within the data folder in the main eelpond directory, the file would look like this: ``` sample unit fq1 fq2 condition 0Hour 001 data/0Hour_ATCACG_L002_R1_001.extract.fastq.gz data/0Hour_ATCACG_L002_R2_001.extract.fastq.gz time0 0Hour 002 data/0Hour_ATCACG_L002_R1_002.extract.fastq.gz data/0Hour_ATCACG_L002_R2_002.extract.fastq.gz time0 6Hour 001 data/6Hour_CGATGT_L002_R1_001.extract.fastq.gz data/6Hour_CGATGT_L002_R2_001.extract.fastq.gz time6 6Hour 002 data/6Hour_CGATGT_L002_R1_002.extract.fastq.gz data/6Hour_CGATGT_L002_R2_002.extract.fastq.gz time6 ``` If we want to download the test data instead: ``` sample unit fq1 fq2 condition 0Hour 001 https://osf.io/vw4dt/download https://osf.io/b47s2/download time0 0Hour 002 https://osf.io/92jr6/download https://osf.io/qzea8/download time0 6Hour 001 https://osf.io/ft3am/download https://osf.io/jqmsx/download time6 6Hour 002 https://osf.io/rnkq3/download https://osf.io/bt9vh/download time6 ``` Note that proper formatting means all columns must be separated by tabs, not spaces! If you'd like to start from a working version, copy the sample data: cp examples/nema.samples.tsv my_samples.tsv Note: at the moment, eelpond assumes all input data is gzipped . Choosing and running a workflow \u00b6 The default workflow is the Eel Pond RNAseq workflow , but we offer several other end-to-end workflows, as well as a number of \"subworkflows\" that facilitate running (or re-running) certain steps of the workflows. To see the available workflows and subworkflows, run: ./run_eelpond examples/nema.yaml -w Configuring Programs in the workflow \u00b6 For any workflow, we need to provide a configuration file that specifies the path to your samples file (generated above). To get a configfile for the default \"eel pond\" workflow, that you can modify, run: ./run_eelpond my_workflow.yaml --build_config The output should be a yaml configfile. At the top, you should see: #################### Eelpond Pipeline Configfile #################### basename: eelpond experiment: _experiment1 samples: samples.tsv Customizing the Output Location and Names \u00b6 First, change the samples.tsv name to your my_samples.tsv file. Then, modify the basename and any experiment info you'd like to add. The default output directory will be: basename_experiment_out within the main eelpond directory. If you'd like, you can add one more parameter to the top section: out_path: OUTPUT_PATH , if you'd like the output to go somewhere other than the eelpond directory. Note the basename and experiment are still used to determine the output directory name. Customizing program parameters: \u00b6 Below this section, you should see some parameters for each program run in this workflow. For example, here's the first few programs: a utility to download or link your data, quality trim with trimmomtic, and assess quality with fastqc. Program parameters do not always show up in order in this file - order in this file does not affect program run order. get_data: download_data: false use_ftp: false trimmomatic: adapter_file: pe_path: ep_utils/TruSeq3-PE-2.fa se_path: ep_utils/TruSeq3-SE.fa trim_cmd: ILLUMINACLIP:{}:2:40:15 LEADING:2 TRAILING:2 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:25 extra: '' fastqc: extra: '' Override default params for any program by modifying the values for any of the paramters under that program name.

For example, under the trimmomatic section, you can modify the \"extra\" param to pass any extra trimmomatic parameters, e.g.: trimmomatic: extra: 'HEADCROP:5' # to remove the first 5 bases at the front of the read.

If a protein dataset is available, this can also be supplied to the dammit pipeline with --user-databases as optional evidence for annotation. In addition, BUSCO v3 is run, which will compare the gene content in your transcriptome with a lineage-specific data set. The output is a proportion of your transcriptome that matches with the data set, which can be used as an estimate of the completeness of your transcriptome based on evolutionary expectation ( Simho et al.2015 ). There are several lineage-specific datasets available from the authors of BUSCO. We will use the metazoa dataset for this transcriptome. Computational Requirements \u00b6 For the standard pipeline, dammit needs ~18GB of storage space to store its prepared databases, plus a few hundred MB per BUSCO database. For the standard annotation pipeline, we recommend at least 16GB of RAM. This can be reduced by editing LAST parameters via a custom configuration file. The full pipeline, which uses uniref90, needs several hundred GB of space and considerable RAM to prepare the databases. You'll also want either a fat internet connection or a big cup of patience to download uniref. For some species, we have found that the amount of RAM required can be proportional to the size of the transcriptome being annotated. While dammit runs, it will print out which tasks its running to the terminal. dammit is written with a library called pydoit , which is a python workflow library similar to GNU Make and Snakemake. This not only helps organize the underlying workflow, but also means that if we interrupt it, it should properly resume! Caveat: if your job dies, without properly shutting down, snakemake will leave your directory \"locked\" (a safety feature to prevent two runs/programs from editing the same file simultaneously). If this happens, you'll need to run eelpond with the --unlock flag. Dammit Commands \u00b6 dammit has two major subcommands: dammit databases and dammit annotate . databases checks that the databases are installed and prepared, and if run with the --install flag, will perform that installation and preparation. annotate then performs the annotation using installed tools and databases. These commands are automated and integrated into a single rule in eelpond . At some point, these may be split into databases and annotate if that functionality is desired, but it's not in our immediate plans. By default, databases are placed at eelpond/databases . Both databases and annotate have a --quick option, that only installs or runs a \"quick\" version of the pipeline: transdecoder On the command line, the commands we would run are as follows: Databases \u00b6 #install databases dammit databases --install --busco-group metazoa --busco-group eukaryota Note: if you have limited space on your instance, you can also install these databases in a different location (e.g. on an external volume) by adding --database-dir /path/to/databases . You can also use a custom protein database for your species. If your critter is a non-model organism, you will likely need to create your own with proteins from closely-related species. This will rely on your knowledge of your system! Annotation \u00b6 dammit annotate trinity.nema.fasta --busco-group metazoa --user-databases <your-database-here> --n_threads 6 If you want to run a quick version of the pipeline, add a parameter, --quick , to omit OrthoDB, Uniref, Pfam, and Rfam. A \"full\" run will take longer to install and run, but you'll have access to the full annotation pipeline. Running Dammit \u00b6 Run Dammit via the \"default\" Eel Pond workflow or via the annotate subworkflow . To run Dammit as a standalone program, see \"Advanced Usage\" section below. Modifying Params for Dammit: \u00b6 Be sure to set up your sample info and build a configfile first (see Understanding and Configuring Workflows ). To see the available parameters for the dammit rule, run ./run_eelpond config dammit --print_params This will print the following: #################### dammit #################### dammit: busco_group: # specify all busco groups below here - metazoa - eukaryota db_dir: databases # specify location for databases (or previously installed databases) db_install_only: False # just install databases, don't run annotation db_extra: annot_extra: ' --quick ' ##################################################### In addition to changing parameters we've specifically enabled, you can modify the extra param to pass any extra parameters. In dammit, both databases and annotation take an extra param: db_extra: '--someflag someparam --someotherflag thatotherparam' annot_extra: '--someflag someparam --someotherflag thatotherparam' Within the \"default\" Eel Pond workflow , this will annotate the Trinity assembly. Since Dammit requires an assembly as input, see the annotate subworkflow instructions for how to run dammit as a standalone rule. See the dammit documentation for all params you can pass into Dammit. Dammit Output \u00b6 Your main output directory will be determined by your config file: by default it is BASENAME_out (you specify BASENAME). Dammit will output files in the annotation subdirectory of this output directory. The annotated fasta file will be ASSEMBLY.dammit.fasta and the annotation gff3 file will be ASSEMBLY.dammit.gff3 . Dammit will also produce a number of intermediate files that will be contained within an ASSEMBLY.fasta.dammit folder. After a successful run, you'll have a new directory called BASENAME.fasta.dammit . If you look inside, you'll see a lot of files. For example, for a transcriptome with basename trinity.nema , the folder trinity.nema.fasta.dammit should contain the following files after a standard (not --quick ) run: ls trinity.nema.fasta.dammit/ annotate.doit.db trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.namemap.csv trinity.nema.fasta.transdecoder.pep dammit.log trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.stats.json trinity.nema.fasta.x.nema.reference.prot.faa.crbl.csv run_trinity.nema.fasta.metazoa.busco.results trinity.nema.fasta.transdecoder.bed trinity.nema.fasta.x.nema.reference.prot.faa.crbl.gff3 tmp trinity.nema.fasta.transdecoder.cds trinity.nema.fasta.x.nema.reference.prot.faa.crbl.model.csv trinity.nema.fasta trinity.nema.fasta.transdecoder_dir trinity.nema.fasta.x.nema.reference.prot.faa.crbl.model.plot.pdf trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.fasta trinity.nema.fasta.transdecoder.gff3 trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.gff3 trinity.nema.fasta.transdecoder.mRNA As part of eelpond, we copy the two most important files, trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.fasta and trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.gff3 into the main annotation directory. trinity.nema.fasta.dammit.stats.json also gives summary stats that are quite useful. If the above dammit command is run again, there will be a message: **Pipeline is already completed!** If you'd like to rerun the dammit pipeline, you'll need to use the --forceall flag, like so: ./run_eelpond examples/nema.yaml annotation --forceall Additional Notes (non-eelpond): Parsing Dammit GFF3 files \u00b6 Camille wrote dammit in Python, which includes a library to parse gff3 dammit output.

Paladin solves the problem of mapping nucleotide sequences back to amino acid sequences. From the documentation : Protein ALignment And Detection INterface PALADIN is a protein sequence alignment tool designed for the accurate functional characterization of metagenomes. PALADIN is based on BWA, and aligns sequences via read-mapping using BWT. PALADIN, however, offers the novel approach of aligning in the protein space. During the index phase, it processes the reference genome's nucleotide sequences and GTF/GFF annotation containing CDS entries, first converting these transcripts into the corresponding protein sequences, then creating the BWT and suffix array from these proteins. The process of translatation is skiped when providing a protein reference file (e.g., UniProt) for mapping. During the alignment phase, it attempts to find ORFs in the read sequences, then converts these to protein sequences, and aligns to the reference protein sequences. PALADIN currently only supports single-end reads (or reads merged with FLASH, PEAR, abyss-mergepairs), and BWA-MEM based alignment. It makes use of many BWA parameters and is therefore compatible with many of its command line arguments. PALADIN may output a standard SAM file, or a text file containing a UniProt-generated functional profile. This text file may be used for all downstream characterizations. Quickstart: Running Paladin with eelpond \u00b6 We recommend you run paladin as part of the Protein Assembly or paladin_map workflows. ./run_eelpond examples/nema.yaml protein_assembly This will run trimmomatic trimming prior to PEAR merging (for paired end reads) and paladin mapping. Note, PEAR only works on paired end reads, as there's nothing to do for single end reads. By default, SE reads are taken directly from trimmomatic output. Paladin Commands \u00b6 Eelpond first indexes the protein assembly, and then maps reads back. On the command line, these commands would look like this: paladin index 3 index_basename \\ gff_annotation extra We have not yet added dammit annotation gff at this step, but this could be done :). You can also add any gff3 annotation via the params. paladin align -f 250 -t snakemake.threads \\ index_basename reads_file | samtools view -Sb - > output.bam Modifying Params for Paladin: \u00b6 Be sure to set up your sample info and build a configfile first (see Understanding and Configuring Workflows ). To see the available parameters for the Paladin rule, run ./run_eelpond config paladin --print_params This will print the following: #################### paladin #################### paladin: alignment_params: extra: '' f: 125 index_params: reference_type: '3' gff_file: '' ##################################################### In addition to changing parameters we've specifically enabled, you can modify the extra param to pass in additional parameters to paladin align , e.g.: extra: ' --some_param that_param ' Please see the Paladin documentation for info on the params you can pass into paladin . Be sure the modified lines go into the config file you're using to run eelpond (see Understanding and Configuring Workflows ). Advanced Usage: Running PALADIN as a standalone rule \u00b6 You can run paladin as a standalone rule, instead of withing a larger eelpond workflow. However, to do this, you need to make sure the input files are available. For paladin, you need both 1) an assembly, and 2) trimmed (and merged) input files. The assembly can be generated via another workflow, or passed to eelpond via the configfile. Specifying an assembly: 1) If you've already run read trimming and want to use a Trinity assembly generated via eelpond , run the following: ./run_eelpond my_config plass_assemble paladin # eelpond will run or locate the plass assembly 2) Alternatively, you can input an assembly via the assemblyinput utility rule, with an assembly in your yaml configfile. ./run_eelpond assemblyinput paladin In config file: assemblyinput: assembly: examples/nema.assembly.fasta gene_trans_map: examples/nema.assembly.fasta.gene_trans_map #optional assembly_extension: '_plass' This is commented out in the test data yaml, but go ahead and uncomment (remove leading # ) in order to use this option. If you have a gene to transcript map, please specify it as well. If not, delete this line from your config . The assembly_extension parameter is important: this is what allows us to build assemblies from several different assemblers on the same dataset. Make sure you set the assembly_extension parameter to plass, as paladin only works on plassassemblies (for the moment). Note: Please don't use additional underscores ( _ ) in this extension! .

Paladin solves the problem of mapping nucleotide sequences back to amino acid sequences. From the documentation : Protein ALignment And Detection INterface PALADIN is a protein sequence alignment tool designed for the accurate functional characterization of metagenomes. PALADIN is based on BWA, and aligns sequences via read-mapping using BWT. PALADIN, however, offers the novel approach of aligning in the protein space. During the index phase, it processes the reference genome's nucleotide sequences and GTF/GFF annotation containing CDS entries, first converting these transcripts into the corresponding protein sequences, then creating the BWT and suffix array from these proteins. The process of translatation is skiped when providing a protein reference file (e.g., UniProt) for mapping. During the alignment phase, it attempts to find ORFs in the read sequences, then converts these to protein sequences, and aligns to the reference protein sequences. PALADIN currently only supports single-end reads (or reads merged with FLASH, PEAR, abyss-mergepairs), and BWA-MEM based alignment. It makes use of many BWA parameters and is therefore compatible with many of its command line arguments.

Although this is a powerful method, it often fails when: There is sequencing errors There are repetitive regions There is strain variation When assembly fails, contigs either break or don't assemble at all.

Salmon is a (relatively) new breed of software for quantifying RNAseq reads that is both really fast and takes transcript length into consideration ( Patro et al. 2015 ). Quickstart \u00b6 We recommend that you run salmon quantification via the \"default\" Eel Pond workflow or the quantify subworkflow . See \"Advanced Usage\" below for running salmon as a standalone rule. Salmon Commands \u00b6 There are two commands for salmon, salmon index and salmon quant . The first command, salmon index will index the transcriptome: salmon index --index nema --transcripts nema_trinity.fasta --type quasi And the second command, salmon quant will quantify the trimmed reads (not diginormed) using the transcriptome. For each pair of reads for a sample, we run: salmon quant -i nema -l A -1 <(gunzip -c $R1) -2 <(gunzip -c $R2) -o ${sample_name}_quant Both indexing the transcriptome and running quantification are integrated as rules in the eelpond workflow, so the whole process happens in an automated fashion.

Using trimmed data as input is recommended, this is just if you're pre-trimmed with another program! In addition to changing parameters we've specifically enabled, you can modify the extra param to pass any extra parameters.In salmon, both index and quantification steps can accept an extra param. See the Salmon documentation to learn more about the parameters you can pass into salmon . Be sure the modified lines go into the config file you're using to run eelpond (see Understanding and Configuring Workflows ). Output files: \u00b6 Your main output directory will be determined by your config file: by default it is BASENAME_out (you specify BASENAME). Salmon will output files in the quant subdirectory of this output directory. Each sample will have its own directory, and the two most interesting files will be the salmon_quant.log and quant.sf files. The former contains the log information from running salmon, and the latter contains the transcript count data. A quant.sf file will look something like this.

However, to do this, you need to make sure the input files are available. For salmon, you need both 1) an assembly, and 2) trimmed input files. The assembly can be generated via another workflow, or passed to eelpond via the configfile. Specifying an assembly: 1) If you've alread run read trimming and want to use a Trinity assembly generated via eelpond , you can run: ./run_eelpond my_config assemble salmon If you've already run the assembly, eelpond will just use this info to locate that assembly. 2) Alternatively, you can input an assembly via the [assemblyinput](assemblyinput.md) utility rule: ``` ./run_eelpond assemblyinput salmon ``` with an assembly in your `yaml` configfile, e.g.: ``` assemblyinput: assembly: examples/nema.assembly.fasta gene_trans_map: examples/nema.assembly.fasta.gene_trans_map #optional assembly_extension: '_input' ``` This is commented out in the test data yaml, but go ahead and uncomment (remove leading `#`) in order to use this option. If you have a gene to transcript map, please specify it as well. If not, delete this line from your `config`. The `assembly_extension` parameter is important: this is what allows us to build assemblies from several different assemblers on the same dataset. Feel free to use `_input`, as specified above, or pick something equally simple yet more informative. **Note: Please don't use additional underscores (`_`) in this extension!**. For more details, see the [assemblyinput documentation](assemblyinput.md). Specifying input reads: If you haven't yet run read trimming, you'll also need to run those steps: ``` ./run_eelpond myconfig get_data trimmomatic salmon ``` Or if you have set `input_trimmomatic_trimmed: False`: ``` ./run_eelpond myconfig get_data salmon ``` Snakemake Rule \u00b6 We wrote snakemake wrappers to run salmon index and salmon quant .

The user chooses a tool or workflow, and ./run_eelpond aggregates all of the default parameters for that tool or workflow, build end-stage target files, and passes this information into the snakefile. Snakemake then builds a DAG of the workflow and runs the workflow in an automated manner. Program Rules \u00b6 The unit at the heart of all workflows is a standalone snakemake rule for a program function. Rules are all placed within subdirectories of the rules directory. For example, the trinity rule is found at rules/trinity/trinity.rule . Utility rules are instead found at, for example: rules/utils/get_data.rule . Each rule needs several files: rulename.rule : the snakemake rule(s) for this program. rulename-env.yaml : a conda environment file for this program. This is passed into the conda snakemake directive in the rule. (optional) rulename-wrapper.py or rulename-script.R : a script that is used to more easily and reproducibly run the program. rulename_params.yaml : a parameter file to direct program output and set default program parameters The last file ( _params ) provides program defaults that can be overridden by user input from the main config file (via a nested dictionary update). The parameters do need to be exact, however. The --print_params and --build_config options in ./run_eelpond are designed to facilitate this. Rule Params \u00b6 The rule params files (above) have two components: eelpond_params and program_params . program_params are exposed to the user when displaying parameters or building configfiles. These are relatively safe to modify, and most get passed into the program rule itself. On the other hand, eelpond_params are used internally to build the names of output files when they need to be passed to the Snakefile as \"targets\". These are never exposed to the user and should be set just once when a rule is built.

Whereever possible, program params also include an extra parameter that enable the user to pass any number of parameters directly to the command line of that program. The eelpond_params specify that trinity produces two files, with the assembly_extension '_trinity'. These will be BASENAME_trinity.fasta and BASENAME_trinity.fasta.gene_trans_map .

If a protein dataset is available, this can also be supplied to the dammit pipeline with --user-databases as optional evidence for annotation. In addition, BUSCO v3 is run, which will compare the gene content in your transcriptome with a lineage-specific data set. The output is a proportion of your transcriptome that matches with the data set, which can be used as an estimate of the completeness of your transcriptome based on evolutionary expectation ( Simho et al. 2015 ). There are several lineage-specific datasets available from the authors of BUSCO. We will use the metazoa dataset for this transcriptome.

We recommend quantifying using the Trinity transcriptome assembly fasta file, which will give expression values for each contig, like this in quant.sf : Name Length EffectiveLength TPM NumReads TRINITY_DN2202_c0_g1_i1 210 39.818 2.683835 2.000000 TRINITY_DN2270_c0_g1_i1 213 41.064 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2201_c0_g1_i1 266 69.681 0.766816 1.000000 TRINITY_DN2222_c0_g1_i1 243 55.794 2.873014 3.000000 TRINITY_DN2291_c0_g1_i1 245 56.916 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2269_c0_g1_i1 294 89.251 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2269_c1_g1_i1 246 57.479 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2279_c0_g1_i1 426 207.443 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2262_c0_g1_i1 500 280.803 0.190459 1.000912 TRINITY_DN2253_c0_g1_i1 1523 1303.116 0.164015 4.000000 TRINITY_DN2287_c0_g1_i1 467 247.962 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2287_c1_g1_i1 325 113.826 0.469425 1.000000 TRINITY_DN2237_c0_g1_i1 306 98.441 0.542788 1.000000 TRINITY_DN2237_c0_g2_i1 307 99.229 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2250_c0_g1_i1 368 151.832 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2250_c1_g1_i1 271 72.988 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2208_c0_g1_i1 379 162.080 1.978014 6.000000 TRINITY_DN2277_c0_g1_i1 269 71.657 0.745677 1.000000 TRINITY_DN2231_c0_g1_i1 209 39.409 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2231_c1_g1_i1 334 121.411 0.000000 0.000000 TRINITY_DN2204_c0_g1_i1 287 84.121 0.000000 0.000000 There are two commands for salmon, salmon index and salmon quant . The first command, salmon index will index the transcriptome: salmon index --index nema --transcripts trinity.nema.full.fasta --type quasi And the second command, salmon quant will quantify the trimmed reads (not diginormed) using the transcriptome: for R1 in *R1*.fastq.gz do sample=$(basename $R1 extract.fastq.gz) echo sample is $sample, R1 is $R1 R2=${R1/R1/R2} echo R2 is $R2 salmon quant -i nema -p 2 -l IU -1 <(gunzip -c $R1) -2 <(gunzip -c $R2) -o ${sample}quant done","title":"Quantification with Salmon"}]}
